# Static Patching Configuration Files

- My T450 Static patch method. This should only be used with T450's and may not work. The SSDTs are universal but you may have to patch your own DSDT to use. You can look over mine for reference. Especially in the battery section.

#

Dsl Folder
 
- Collection of dsl files which can be used to add to the StaticPatch method for specific purposes. Make sure you understand whats going on before using them.
